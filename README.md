BTECH_EVALUATION_TASK
Raster Tile Mosaicing
A raster mosaicing task focused on generating a cloudless mosaic image by seamlessly merging multiple georeferenced satellite raster tiles (GeoTIFFs). The code should efficiently combine overlapping tiles with consistent spatial resolution and coordinate reference systems, ensuring smooth transitions between scenes. The final output must be a clean, cloud-free mosaic, properly georeferenced and visualized using Python-based geospatial libraries. The complete workflow should be demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle/Colab) using the provided sample raster tiles.

Key Requirements
Design a Python-based workflow to merge multiple adjacent GeoTIFF raster tiles into a single cloudless mosaic.
Ensure proper handling of spatial reference, alignment, and NoData values.
Produce a seamless, georeferenced raster output suitable for visualization and analysis.
Demonstrate the complete process in a Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle/Colab) using sample data.
Input Files
The task uses a set of adjacent georeferenced raster tiles (GeoTIFFs) representing a cloudless satellite scene. Candidates must download these input files from the link below and use them for all processing and demonstration.
